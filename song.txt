I look above the stars are bright
Yet I'm blinded by your light
Heaven seems so far away
Come back to me someday

The sky seems so blue
They lead me to you
Somewhere there's a place in my heart
In the skies of love

My faith lies with you
Protect all you do
There's always a place in my heart
In the skies of love
